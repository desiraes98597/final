## Why I feel SEO is important

I have a friend who has a baloon buiness and she has talked many times about how important SEO was to her business.
She would go in monthly and add or change Key words, follow SEO information n google and basically spend a great deal timenoting how far up in the search results her business was. She was very sucessful in getting the business to move up with just key words and not paying for any bump in search results. 
I learned early on that if you do not add the correct keywords to your site, noone will ever see it. 
I plan on focusing very heavyily on adding any and all keyowrds related to my site and to comtinuly monitor the search progess. Since my portfolio site is my name, without keywords relating to what I want to get noticed for, it will never happen.
